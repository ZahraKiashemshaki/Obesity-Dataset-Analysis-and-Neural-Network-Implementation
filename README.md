# Wrapper_Method_ObesityDataSet
Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a feature selection technique using the Wrapper Method on the Obesity Data Set. The objective of this project is to identify the most relevant features for predicting obesity-related outcomes using a machine learning model. The Wrapper Method is particularly useful because it evaluates feature subsets based on their performance with a specific learning algorithm, allowing for the selection of features that are most predictive.

Project Description

The goal of this project is to apply the Wrapper Method for feature selection on the Obesity Data Set. The Wrapper Method involves training a machine learning model on different subsets of features and selecting the subset that provides the best performance. This technique is computationally intensive but often yields better performance than filter-based methods.

The key components of this project include:

Data preprocessing and exploration
Implementation of the Wrapper Method
Evaluation of feature subsets using machine learning models
Analysis of the selected features and model performance

Dataset

The Obesity Data Set used in this project contains various attributes related to lifestyle, dietary habits, and physical activities.
